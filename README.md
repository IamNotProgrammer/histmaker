# histmaker
Program that helps making histogram because finding something like that for some reason is so god damn hard

Just use `gcc hist.c` to compile it. I don't want compilation process to be like Linux From Scratch
To use program use `./a.out foo` where foo is file name, file (for now) should look like this

123.511
185.362
50.12
200.516
....

Just values in 1 column and program will sort it out and spew out histogram
